This program demonstrates integration of Websocket
with Play2 framework.

HTTP Get requests are used to vote for a soccer player in AttendeesDB.

Google Chrome's Dark Websocket terminal is used as Websocket client.

As more votes are polled for a soccer player in AttendeesDB, the current votes polled
are displayed in the Websocket terminal.

This code uses old (deprecated) Java WebSocket APIs of Play. 
But, this may be replaced with more functional Scala interface, by Java8 lambdas!
